If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. 
The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

(Some definitions, including the standard ISO 80000-2,[4][a] begin the natural numbers with 0,
corresponding to the non-negative integers 0, 1, 2, 3, ... 
(collectively denoted by the symbol {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} _{0}}\mathbb {N} _{0}), 
whereas others start with 1, corresponding to the positive integers 1, 2, 3, ... 
(collectively denoted by the symbol {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} _{1}}\mathbb {N} _{1}).)
